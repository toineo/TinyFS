____ Integration ____
- Inline mbr code from partition code
- Get/Set byte in BytArray
- Layer with disk and bytearray
- Layer with filesystem code

For proofs:
- Only use int/unsigned int
- Avoid bit manipulation (-> that way omega can solve it)

____ Misc ____
- Clean headers using #pragma once
- Refactor BinaryData (conversion functions) + convert to big endian
- Instead of bin_to_uint..., use bin_to_diskaddr, etc
- Finish block allocation and add a function to set the file size
- Error handling
- Write our own functions for strings

____ Design ____
- Implement bigger buffers/blocks (bigger than 1 disk sector, as currently done)
  -> take advantage of disk reads/writes that can copy more than 1 sector
